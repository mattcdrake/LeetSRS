# LeetSRS Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: January 11, 2026**

LeetSRS is a Chrome extension that helps you with spaced repetition for
LeetCode problems. Your privacy is important. This policy explains what
information the extension handles and where it is stored.

## Data We Handle

LeetSRS **does not** collect, transmit, or store any of your personal data on
our servers. All data generated by the extension is stored in one of two
places:

1.  **On Your Local Machine (`chrome.storage.local`):**
    - Your saved LeetCode problems (cards), including review history and notes.
    - Your daily review statistics.

2.  **In Your Personal Cloud Storage (`chrome.storage.sync`):**
    - Your extension settings, such as theme and daily limits.
    - Your GitHub Personal Access Token (if you enable GitHub Gist sync).

This data is managed by your browser and is not accessible to us.

## Optional GitHub Gist Sync

LeetSRS offers an optional feature to sync your data across browsers using
GitHub Gists. This feature is **disabled by default** and requires you to:

1. Create a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) with the `gist` scope.
2. Explicitly enable sync in the extension settings.

When enabled:

- Your extension data (cards, stats, notes, and settings) is uploaded to a
  **private** GitHub Gist that you own.
- Your PAT is stored locally in your browser and is sent only to GitHub's API
  (`api.github.com`) to authenticate sync requests.
- **We never receive or have access to your PAT or synced data.**

You can disable this feature at any time, and your Gist will remain under your
control on GitHub.

## Data Usage and Sharing

If you use GitHub Gist sync, your data is shared only with GitHub
under their privacy policy. Aside from that, your data is not shared with
any other party.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this
page.
